### About me

<b>A problem solver who uses computers ðŸ’» and code ðŸ’¾</b>
- :gear: I love **efficient and elegant** solutions.
- :toolbox: Tools: always try to decide based on **trade-offs and numbers**.
- :zap: I love **performance** tuning.

  <summary>Pros/Cons (depends on you)</summary>
  
  - avoids applying (using) a method (tool) that I don't have a basic understanding, otherwise I feel uncomfortable :(
  - tends to have multiple interests and do interdisciplinary projects.

  > SWE and MLE have widely different tasks or knowledge base,
  > thus may use different tech or tool stacks;
  > but both of them solve problems ==>  I'm a problem solver.
  >
  > I lean more towards SWE with CV and Cybersecurity applications.
